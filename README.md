## Overview

Create a simple app that shows a stack of 10 photo cards. The user can interact with the top photo to pinch, rotate or drag. When the touches end the card is animated to the bottom of the stack. The second photo is now on top and the user can interact with the second photo (which can also be dragged away to reveal the third photo, and so on...)
